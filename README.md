# Hospitality Analytics Power BI Dashboard

This project is an end-to-end Power BI analytics solution built to evaluate operational and financial performance in the hospitality industry. The dashboard transforms raw hotel booking and revenue data into actionable insights, enabling stakeholders to monitor KPIs, identify trends, and optimize pricing and occupancy strategies.

## Business Problem
Hospitality businesses generate large volumes of booking and revenue data but often lack a centralized view to track performance across properties, cities, and customer segments. This dashboard addresses that gap by providing a single, interactive view of critical performance metrics.

## Key KPIs & Analysis
- Revenue and RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)
- Occupancy Percentage and Average Daily Rate (ADR)
- Realisation %, Cancellation %, and Demand Supply Metrics (DSRN, DURN, DBRN)
- Weekday vs Weekend performance comparison
- Revenue contribution by hotel category (Luxury vs Business)
- Booking platform performance analysis
- Property-level and city-level benchmarking

## Dashboard Capabilities
- Interactive slicers for City and Room Type
- Time-series trend analysis for RevPAR, ADR, and Occupancy
- Drill-down table for property-wise performance
- Visual comparison of pricing efficiency and realization across booking platforms

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- Power BI for data visualization and storytelling
- DAX for calculated measures and KPIs
- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
- Data modeling and relationship management
- Business analytics and KPI-driven decision support

## Outcome & Insights
- Identified high-performing properties and cities driving revenue
